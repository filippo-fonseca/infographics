**3. CHANGELOG Poster:**

Dear Mr. K,

In order to save you time (as that is one of the most important and non-recoverable elements of our lives), I have made a CHANGELOG Poster containing all of the active changes made for the resubmission of this project on Monday, December 7th, 2020.

I hope you enjoy it. :):

Best,
Filippo Fonseca

**4. Interactive Website Content Walkthrough & Display:**

For this project, in order to add more information and make it fascinatingly more interesting and engaging to my audience, I decided I would make a website that promote an exciting and electrifying learning experience.

You can check out the link to the website [here](https://infographics.vercel.app/).

A preview of what the home page looks like:

Once again, because I wanted to go the extra mile, I also made a brief explainer video on Loom. Feel free to watch it at 2x speed to save time :).
