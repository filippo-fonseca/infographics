# ❄️ TypeScript Template for NextJS

A starter template for using [TypeScript](https://threejs.org) with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) & server-side rendering (SSR) quickly and out-of-the-box so you can focus on what really matters - programming, not setup & config.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository to get started and `cd` into the folder (feel free to rename it to your liking according to the name of your project):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:filippo-fonseca/next-ts-template.git

cd next-ts-template
```

Next, install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm i
```

**NOTE:** You can use either Yarn or npm, although it is recommended to use Yarn for this project (as it is the standard for NextJS-based projects).

Lastly, let's run the development server!

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The following starter page should be rendered on the screen with the default boilerplate code for this template, as such:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/XDQrGXN/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-16-00-29.png" />

You can now start editing the page and your app by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. Feel free to make it your own (treat it like a normal app generated with `npx create-next-app` or `yarn create next-app`).
